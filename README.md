## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MLeClair97/ai-operations-supply-chain-eval.git
cd ai-operations-supply-chain-eval
```

## Data Source

The platform uses a supply chain logistics dataset containing:
- **Products**: 5 different product categories (Widgets, Gadgets, Tools)
- **Suppliers**: 5 suppliers with varying performance metrics
- **Warehouses**: 3 distribution locations
- **Logistics Partners**: 5 different logistics companies
- **Shipping Methods**: Air, Road, Rail, Sea transportation options
- **Performance Tracking**: Delivery status, costs, and timing data

*Note: Delivery dates have been updated to current timeframes for realistic demo purposes.*

**Original Data Source**: [Kaggle Supply Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/discovertalent143/supply-chain-dataset)

## Key Insights & Business Value

### Operational Intelligence
- **32% of orders experience delays**, creating significant operational risk
- **FastTrans logistics partner shows 45.5% delay rate** vs FleetPro at 11.1%
- **$27,911 in delayed shipments** represents 38.5% of total operational costs
- **68% overall performance rate** indicates need for systematic improvements

### Cost Optimization Opportunities
- **15-20% potential cost savings** through supplier consolidation and pricing standardization
- **High price variation across products** suggests inconsistent procurement practices
- **Volume consolidation opportunities** with low-volume suppliers
- **Logistics efficiency improvements** could reduce both costs and delays

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Address supplier performance issues (highest ROI opportunity)
2. **Short-term**: Standardize pricing across product categories
3. **Medium-term**: Implement predictive analytics for demand forecasting
4. **Long-term**: Diversify logistics partner portfolio to reduce delivery risk

## Architecture & Design

### Modular Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data processing, AI analysis, and visualization components are isolated
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to extend with additional analytics or data sources
